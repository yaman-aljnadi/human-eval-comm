You want to remove all elements that occur K times from a list of integers, while keeping the order of the remaining elements the same.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number in the list. Then, we can iterate through the list and add each number to the result list only if its count is less than K.\n\nHere's the Python3 code that implements this solution:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef candidate(numbers: List[int], K: int) -> List[int]:\n    count_dict = {}\n    result = []\n    \n    for num in numbers:\n        if num not in count_dict:\n            count_dict[num] = 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[num] += 1\n            \n    for num in numbers:\n        if count_dict[num] < K:\n            result.append(num)\n            \n    return result\n```\nHere's an example of how to use this function:\n```python\n>>> candidate([1, 2, 3, 2, 4], 2)\n[1, 3, 4]\n```\nThis function takes a list of integers and an integer K as input, and returns a new list that contains all the elements from the input list that occur less than or equal to K times.", "answer": "", "question_quality": "0", "code": ""}

So, I'm assuming that the first signed digit of a positive number should be positive as well.\n\nBased on this clarification, here's the Python3 code for the `count_nums` function:\n\n```python\ndef count_nums(arr):\n    count = 0\n    for num in arr:\n        if sum(int(digit) for digit in str(abs(num))) > 0:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each number in the input array. For each number, it calculates the sum of its digits using the `sum` function and the `str` function to convert the number to a string, and then iterates over each digit using a generator expression. If the sum of the digits is greater than 0, the function increments the `count` variable. Finally, it returns the `count` variable.", "answer": "", "question_quality": "0", "code": ""}

You want to remove all elements that occur K times from a list of integers, while keeping the order of the remaining elements the same.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number in the list. Then, we can iterate through the list and add each number to the result list only if its count is less than K.\n\nHere's the Python3 code that implements this solution:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef candidate(numbers: List[int], K: int) -> List[int]:\n    count_dict = {}\n    result = []\n    \n    for num in numbers:\n        if num not in count_dict:\n            count_dict[num] = 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[num] += 1\n            \n    for num in numbers:\n        if count_dict[num] < K:\n            result.append(num)\n            \n    return result\n```\nHere's an example of how to use this function:\n```python\n>>> candidate([1, 2, 3, 2, 4], 2)\n[1, 3, 4]\n```\nThis function takes a list of integers and an integer K as input, and returns a new list that contains all the elements from the input list that occur less than or equal to K times.", "answer": "", "question_quality": "0", "code": ""}
