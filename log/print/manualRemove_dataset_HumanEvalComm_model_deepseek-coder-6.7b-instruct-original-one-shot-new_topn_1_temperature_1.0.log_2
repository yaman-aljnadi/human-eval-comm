The `watchedVideos` and `friends` arrays are lists. Each index in the `watchedVideos` list corresponds to a person's id, and the value at that index is a list of videos that person has watched. The `friends` list is similar, with each index corresponding to a person's id and the value at that index being a list of that person's friends' ids.\n\n2. The videos are identified by their unique identifiers. In this case, they are represented as strings.\n\n3. The `level` parameter is an integer that represents the level of friends to consider. It could be any non-negative integer.\n\n4. The friends relationships are represented as an undirected graph. In this case, if person A is a friend of person B, then person B is also a friend of person A.\n\n5. The expected output format is a list of videos, ordered by their frequencies. The videos are represented as strings, and the frequencies are represented as integers. The output could be a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a video and its frequency.\n\nHere is the Python3 code for the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef watchedVideosByFriends(watchedVideos: List[List[str]], friends: List[List[int]], id: int, level: int) -> List[str]:\n    def bfs(graph, start, depth):\n        visited = {start}\n        queue = [(node, 0) for node in graph[start]]\n        while queue:\n            node, dist = queue.pop(0)\n            if dist == depth:\n                yield node\n            elif dist < depth:\n                visited.add(node)\n                queue.extend((i, dist + 1) for i in graph[node] if i not in visited)\n\n    graph = [[] for _ in range(len(friends))]\n    for i, friend_list in enumerate(friends):\n        for j in friend_list:\n            graph[i].append(j)\n            graph[j].append(i)\n\n    people_at_level = list(bfs(graph, id, level))\n    videos_at_level = [watchedVideos[i] for i in people_at_level]\n    flattened_videos = [video for sublist in videos_at_level for video in sublist]\n    counter = Counter(flattened_videos)\n    return [video for video, _ in counter.most_common()]\n```\n\nThis code first constructs a graph using the `friends` list. It then uses a breadth-first search (BFS) to find all people at the given level of friends. It then collects all the watched videos from these people and counts the frequencies of each video. Finally, it returns a list of videos, ordered by their frequencies.\n", "answer": "", "question_quality": "3", "code": ""}

The `level` parameter is an integer that represents the level of the friends to consider. The range of values for this parameter is not specified in the problem, but it is typically assumed to be a positive integer.\n\n4. The friends relationships are typically represented in the `friends` array as a list of lists, where each inner list contains the ids of the friends of a person. This is an undirected graph, meaning that if person `i` is in the list of friends for person `j`, then person `j` is also in the list of friends for person `i`.\n\n5. The expected output format is a list of videos ordered by their frequencies. This means that if a video appears more often than another video, it should be listed first. The videos should be represented as strings, and the frequencies should be represented as integers.\n", "answer": "The modified problem description is missing the requirement of finding the closest vowel between two consonants from the right side of the word.", "question_quality": "3", "code": ""}
