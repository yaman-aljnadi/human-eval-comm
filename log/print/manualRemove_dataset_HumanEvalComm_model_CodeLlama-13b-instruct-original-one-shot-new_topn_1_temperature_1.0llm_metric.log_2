Therefore, we can check if `x` is equal to `n` raised to the power of `1/n` using the `**` operator.\n\nFor example, if `x` is equal to `8` and `n` is equal to `2`, then `x` is a simple power of `n` because `8` is equal to `2` raised to the power of `1/2`, which is `2 ** (1/2) = 2`.\n\nOn the other hand, if `x` is equal to `9` and `n` is equal to `2`, then `x` is not a simple power of `n` because `9` is not equal to `2` raised to the power of `1/2`, which is `2 ** (1/2) = 2`.\n\nTherefore, the function returns `True` if `x` is a simple power of `n`, and `False` otherwise.", "answer": "", "question_quality": "0", "code": "def is_simple_power(x, n):\n    return x == n ** (1 / n)"}

The `watchedVideos` parameter is a dictionary that maps each person's id to a list of videos they have watched. The `friends` parameter is a dictionary that maps each person's id to a list of their friends' ids. The `id` parameter is the id of the person for whom we want to get the list of videos.\n\nThe function first initializes an empty dictionary, `video_freq`, to store the frequencies of videos. It then gets the list of friends for the given id and iterates over the friends list. For each friend, it gets the list of watched videos for that friend and increments the frequency of each video in the `video_freq` dictionary.\n\nAfter iterating over all the friends, the function sorts the `video_freq` dictionary in increasing order based on the frequency of each video. It then returns the list of videos ordered by their frequencies.\n\nNote that the `sorted_video_freq` list is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a video and its frequency. The `video` is the first element of the tuple, and the `freq` is the second element. The `video` is the key of the `video_freq` dictionary, and the `freq` is the value of the `video_freq` dictionary.", "answer": "", "question_quality": "0", "code": "def get_videos(watchedVideos, friends, id, level):\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the frequencies of videos\n    video_freq = {}\n\n    # Get the list of friends for the given id\n    friends_list = friends[id]\n\n    # Iterate over the friends list and get the list of watched videos for each friend\n    for friend in friends_list:\n        # Get the list of watched videos for the current friend\n        friend_videos = watchedVideos[friend]\n\n        # Iterate over the list of watched videos for the current friend and increment the frequency of each video\n        for video in friend_videos:\n            if video not in video_freq:\n                video_freq[video] = 1\n            else:\n                video_freq[video] += 1\n\n    # Sort the video frequencies in increasing order\n    sorted_video_freq = sorted(video_freq.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n    # Return the list of videos ordered by their frequencies\n    return [video for video, freq in sorted_video_freq]"}
