**Role**: As a tester, your task is to create comprehensive test cases for the incomplete function. These test cases should encompass Basic, Edge, and Large Scale scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

**1. Basic Test Cases**:
- **Objective**: To verify the fundamental functionality of the `has_close_elements` function under normal conditions.

**2. Edge Test Cases**:
- **Objective**: To evaluate the function's behavior under extreme or unusual conditions.

**3. Large Scale Test Cases**:
- **Objective**: To assess the functionâ€™s performance and scalability with large data samples.

**Instructions**:
- Implement a comprehensive set of test cases following the guidelines above.
- Ensure each test case is well-documented with comments explaining the scenario it covers.
- Pay special attention to edge cases as they often reveal hidden bugs.
- For large-scale tests, focus on the function's efficiency and performance under heavy loads.

- The format of test cases should be:
```python
assert function_name(input) == expected_output, "Test Case Description"
```


# For example:

## Prompt 1:
```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    """

```

## Completion 1:
```python

assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) == False
assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)== True

```

## Prompt 2:
```python
from typing import List


def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
    separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.
    Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
    Ignore any spaces in the input string.
    >>> separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')
    ['()', '(())', '(()())']
    """

```

## Completion 2:
```python

assert separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))') == ['()', '(())', '(()())']

```
