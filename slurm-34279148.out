You are an expert software developer who writes high quality code. With below information, please either generate Python3 code (Respond directly with code only with markdown), or ask clarifying questions: 

def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    '''
    Create a function that returns a tuple (a, b), where 'a' is
    one of negative integers, and 'b' is one
    of positive integers in a list.
    If there is no negative or positive integers, return them as None.

    Examples:
    largest_smallest_integers([2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7]) == (None, 1)
    largest_smallest_integers([]) == (None, None)
    largest_smallest_integers([0]) == (None, None)

 Here is the Python3 code:

```python
def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    neg = None
    pos = None
    for i in lst:
        if i < 0 and (neg is None or i > neg):
            neg = i
        elif i > 0 and (pos is None or i < pos):
            pos = i
    return (neg, pos)
```

This code works by iterating over each element in the list. If the element is negative and greater than the current largest negative integer, it is stored as the new largest negative integer. If the element is positive and less than the current smallest positive integer, it is stored as the new smallest positive integer. If no negative or positive integers are found, the respective variables are set to None. The function then returns a tuple of the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer.

This code first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns `(None, None)`.

Then, it creates two lists: `negatives` and `positives`. `negatives` contains all the negative integers in the list, and `positives` contains all the positive integers.

Finally, it returns a tuple with the maximum value in `negatives` (or `None` if `negatives` is empty) and the minimum value in `positives` (or `None` if `positives` is empty).

completion:
 The problem description is not clear. It mentions that the given number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4, but it does not specify what the four numbers should be. 

However, I will assume that the four numbers should be even. If that's the case, the Python3 code below will check if `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 even numbers.

```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    if n < 0:
        return False
    if n == 0:
        return True
    if n % 2 != 0:
        return False
    return is_equal_to_sum_even(n - 2)
```

This code uses recursion to check if `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 even numbers. It starts by checking if `n` is negative or zero, in which case it returns `False`. If `n` is even, it subtracts 2 from `n` and calls itself with the new value. If `n` is odd, it returns `False`.

Please clarify the problem description if you need further assistance!

 The Brazilian factorial is defined as:

This code uses a recursive function to calculate the special factorial of a number. The base case is when `n` is 0, in which case the function returns 1. Otherwise, the function returns `n! * special_factorial(n - 1)`.

    n_num, n_den = map(int, n.split('/'))
    return (x_num * n_num) % (x_den * n_den) == 0

```

This code sorts the list `nums` based on the sum of its digits and the index of the item in the original list. The `sorted` function returns a new list that contains the sorted items.

The `key` parameter of the `sorted` function is a function that takes an item from the list and returns a value that will be used for sorting. In this case, the key function is a lambda function that returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the sum of the digits of the item, and the second element is the index of the item in the original list.

The `sorted` function uses the tuple values for sorting. If two items have the same sum of their digits, the item with the lower index in the original list is considered smaller.

 Here is the Python3 code that generates the array `a` based on the given conditions:

```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    a = [i * i + i - 1 if i % 2 == 0 else i * i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    return a
```

This code uses a list comprehension to generate the array `a`. The condition `i % 2 == 0` checks if `i` is even, and if it is, the value of `a[i]` is `i * i + i - 1`. If `i` is odd, the value of `a[i]` is `i * i - i + 1`.

This code uses a generator expression to iterate over the elements in the list. The `isinstance(x, int)` condition checks if the element is an integer, and `x >= 0` checks if the element is non-negative. The `x**2` expression squares the element. The `sum()` function adds up the squares.

 Here is the Python3 code that solves the problem:

```python
def double_the_difference(lst):
    return sum(abs(x)**2 for x in lst)
```

This code works by iterating over each element in the list `lst`, and for each element `x`, it calculates the square of the absolute value of `x` (`abs(x)**2`). The sum of these squares is then returned.

 Here is the Python3 code:

```python
def compare(game, guess):
    return [abs(g - s) if g != s else 0 for g, s in zip(game, guess)]
```

This code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the two input arrays simultaneously. For each pair of elements, it calculates the absolute difference between the two elements if they are not equal. If they are equal, it returns 0. The result is a list of the same length as the input arrays.

 Here is the Python3 code:

```python
def even_odd_count(num):
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    for digit in str(abs(num)):
        if int(digit) % 2 == 0:
            even_count += 1
        else:
            odd_count += 1
    return (even_count, odd_count)
```

This code works by converting the absolute value of the input number to a string, then iterating over each character in the string. If the character is an even number, it increments the `even_count` variable; if it is an odd number, it increments the `odd_count` variable. The function then returns a tuple containing the counts of even and odd digits.

If this is true, then the triangle is right-angled. Otherwise, it is not.

completion:
 The problem description is a bit unclear. It mentions that a right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 90 degree, but it doesn't specify which side of the triangle is the hypotenuse.

However, I will assume that the hypotenuse is the side with the longest length. If this is not the case, please clarify!

Here is a Python3 code snippet that calculates the area of a right-angled triangle:

```python
import math

def candidate(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    '''
    # Sort the sides
    sides = sorted([a, b, c])

    # Check if the triangle is right-angled
    if sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2 == sides[2]**2:
        # Calculate the area
        area = 0.5 * sides[0] * sides[1]
        return area
    else:
        return "Not a right-angled triangle"
```

This code first sorts the lengths of the sides in ascending order. Then it checks if the square of the shortest side (`sides[0]`) plus the square of the next shortest side (`sides[1]`) is equal to the square of the longest side (`sides[2]`). If this is true, the triangle is right-angled

 The function `eat` takes three parameters: `number`, `need`, and `remaining`. The `number` parameter represents the number of carrots you have already eaten, the `need` parameter represents the number of carrots you need to eat to complete the day's meals, and the `remaining` parameter represents the number of carrots remaining in the bowl.

The function should return the number of carrots you need to eat to complete the day's meals.

Here is a Python3 code snippet that implements the `eat` function:

```python
def eat(number, need, remaining):
    return need - number
```

This code snippet subtracts the number of carrots you have already eaten from the number of carrots you need to eat to complete the day's meals. The result is the number of carrots you need to eat to complete the day's meals.

### Response:

completion:
 The function `do_algebra` takes two lists as input: `operator` and `operand`. The first list contains basic algebra operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), and the second list contains integers. The function should return the result of applying the operations in the first list to the integers in the second list.

Here is a Python3 code snippet that implements the `do_algebra` function:

```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    result = 0
    for op, num in zip(operator, operand):
        if op == '+':
            result += num
        elif op == '-':
            result -= num
        elif op == '*':
            result *= num
        elif op == '/':
            result /= num
    return result
```

This code uses the `zip` function to iterate over the two lists simultaneously. The `if`-`elif`-`else` statements handle the different operations. The `result` variable is used to store the result of the operations.

Please note that this code assumes that the input lists are of the same length, and that the second list contains integers. If this is not the case, you will need to add error checking code to handle invalid input.

 The problem description is a bit unclear. The function `candidate` is supposed to take a string as input and return a hash value. However, the example output `'3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'` is not a valid hash value.

If the goal is to hash the input string, then the function should use a hash function like `hashlib.sha256`. Here is a simple example:

```python
import hashlib

def candidate(text):
    return hashlib.sha256(text.encode()).hexdigest()
```

If the goal is to count the number of unique characters in the input string, then the function should use a set to keep track of the unique characters. Here is a simple example:

```python
def candidate(text):
    return len(set(text))
```

Please clarify the problem description!

 The problem description is not clear. However, I will assume that the function should return the number of unique characters in the input text.

Here is the Python3 code:

```python

```

This code works by converting each character in the input text to its ASCII value using the `ord` function, and then converting the set of ASCII values to a string. The `set` function is used to remove duplicate characters.

Please clarify the expected output if the above code does not meet your requirements.

 Here is the Python3 code:

```python
def generate_integers(a, b):
    """
    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between
    """
    return [i for i in range(a, b+1) if i % 2 == 0]
```

This code uses a list comprehension to generate a list of integers between `a` and `b` (inclusive) that are even. The condition `i % 2 == 0` checks if the integer `i` is even. If it is, `i` is included in the list.
