The docstring suggests that the function should return 2^n modulo p, but the function parameters (x, y) don’t match with the variables in the docstring (n, p).
\nHere are my questions to clarify the problem:
\n1. What are the roles of the parameters x and y in the function?
\n2. Should the function return 2^n modulo p as suggested in the docstring? If so, which parameter corresponds to n and which corresponds to p?
\n3. The test cases provided in the docstring don’t seem to match the function description. Could you please provide correct test cases?\n\n### Problem Description:\n {problem} \n\n ### Response:

Here is an example of sample input and output for you:
### Sample input:\n
#### Modified Problem Description:\n python def candidate(x: int, y: int):\n \"\"\"\n Return 2^n modulo p (be aware of numerics).\n >>> candidate(3, 5)\n 3\n >>> candidate(1101, 101)\n 2\n >>> candidate(0, 101)\n 1\n >>> candidate(3, 11)\n 8\n >>> candidate(100, 101)\n 1\n\n  \"\"\"\n
#### Original Description:\n python def modp(n: int, p: int):\n    \"\"\"Return 2^n modulo p (be aware of numerics).\n    >>> modp(3, 5)\n    3\n    >>> modp(1101, 101)\n    2\n    >>> modp(0, 101)\n    1\n    >>> modp(3, 11)\n    8\n    >>> modp(100, 101)\n    1\n    \"\"\"\n
#### Questions: \n - Can you clarify the relationship between the function parameters 'x' and 'y' and the operation parameters \"2^n modulo p\" mentioned in the docstring?\n
- Are there any constraints on the input values for 'x' and 'y' that I should be aware of?\n
- The docstring mentions \"be aware of numerics\". Are there any specific numerical considerations or edge cases I should keep in mind while implementing this function?\n\n
### Sample output:\n
ANSWERS= ```\n
- 'x' represents the exponent (n), and 'y' represents the modulus (p).\n
- There are no explicitly stated constraints on 'x' and 'y'.\n
- There is no extra information about the \"be aware of numerics\" note.\n\n
QUALITY= 3\n
## Now give the output for the problem below:
### Modified Problem Description: {problem} \n ### Original Description: {missing_information} \n ### Questions: {clarifying_questions}\n
