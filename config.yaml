If some residential zone is very far from all commercial zones, then the people living there will have a long journey whenever they want to do some shopping, and this is undesirable.\n\nThe input will consist of an $n\\times n$ grid of square zones. Each zone is labeled 1 (residential), 2 (industrial), or 3 (commercial). When travelling from one zone to another you are allowed to move north, east, south or west, and the distance travelled is the number of zone boundaries you traverse. So the distance between two adjacent zones is $1$, and the distance from the zone in square $(1,1)$ (the most south-westerly zone) to the zone in square $(2,3)$ is $3$ (one step east and two steps north). You may never move off the grid.\n\nYour task is to find the longest distance one has to travel from a residential zone to get to the commercial zone closest to that residential zone.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains an integer $n$, $2\\leq n\\leq 1500$, followed by $n$ lines of length $n$ giving the map of the city zones as an $n\\times n$ matrix where each entry is 1, 2, or 3 depending on zone type. You can assume that the city has zones of all three types except commercial zones.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single integer $d$, the largest distance from a residential zone to its closest commercial zone.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input:\n4\n1223\n2123\n2213\n3212\nSample Output:\n-1\n Yout response:\n 1. The problem description states that the city has zones of all three types except commercial zones. However, the sample input and output provided include commercial zones. Is this a contradiction?\n2. The problem description states that the output should be the largest distance from a residential zone to its closest commercial zone. However, the sample output provided is -1.

\"\"\"\n```\n### Response:\nThe problem description seems to be incomplete. It provides a function signature and some test cases, but it doesn’t specify what the function is supposed to do. The docstring suggests that the function should return 2^n modulo p, but the function parameters (x, y) don’t match with the variables in the docstring (n, p).
\nHere are my questions to clarify the problem:
\n1. What are the roles of the parameters x and y in the function?
\n2. Should the function return 2^n modulo p as suggested in the docstring? If so, which parameter corresponds to n and which corresponds to p?
\n3. The test cases provided in the docstring don’t seem to match the function description. Could you please provide correct test cases?\n\n### Problem Description:\n {problem} \n\n ### Response:

Here is an example of sample input and output for you:
### Sample input:\n
#### Modified Problem Description:\n python def candidate(x: int, y: int):\n \"\"\"\n Return 2^n modulo p (be aware of numerics).\n >>> candidate(3, 5)\n 3\n >>> candidate(1101, 101)\n 2\n >>> candidate(0, 101)\n 1\n >>> candidate(3, 11)\n 8\n >>> candidate(100, 101)\n 1\n\n  \"\"\"\n
#### Original Description:\n python def modp(n: int, p: int):\n    \"\"\"Return 2^n modulo p (be aware of numerics).\n    >>> modp(3, 5)\n    3\n    >>> modp(1101, 101)\n    2\n    >>> modp(0, 101)\n    1\n    >>> modp(3, 11)\n    8\n    >>> modp(100, 101)\n    1\n    \"\"\"\n
#### Questions: \n - Can you clarify the relationship between the function parameters 'x' and 'y' and the operation parameters \"2^n modulo p\" mentioned in the docstring?\n
- Are there any constraints on the input values for 'x' and 'y' that I should be aware of?\n
- The docstring mentions \"be aware of numerics\". Are there any specific numerical considerations or edge cases I should keep in mind while implementing this function?\n\n
### Sample output:\n
ANSWERS= ```\n
- 'x' represents the exponent (n), and 'y' represents the modulus (p).\n
- There are no explicitly stated constraints on 'x' and 'y'.\n
- There is no extra information about the \"be aware of numerics\" note.\n\n
QUALITY= 3\n
## Now give the output for the problem below:
### Modified Problem Description: {problem} \n ### Original Description: {missing_information} \n ### Questions: {clarifying_questions}\n
